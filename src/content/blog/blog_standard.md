A good blog should go beyond visual appeal and technical aspects like loading speed, responsiveness, and mobile-friendly design. It should arrange content in a way that is cognitively efficient for humans and entice readers to continue reading, similar to writing a marketing campaign document.

## Digital Garden
I want to include everything I've learned and make it searchable. I like the idea of digital gardening, so I'll make the more polished blog posts more visible while hiding the entries for rougher drafts.

What is a digital garden?
I like the analogy in [How I built myself a Digital Garden](https://timrodenbroeker.de/digital-garden/). It contains three parts: clouds, drops, and plants.
- Clouds are excerpts of the raw material I consume.
- Drops are notes I make using my own words. Each drop is a self-contained, minimal idea with links to other drops or clouds. I also keep a zettelkasten system for all my drops.
- Plants are the final text products, which can be blog posts, video scripts, design documents, etc.

how to make it grow organically? it is also the idea of incremental writing, the "big picture" of the article is built primarily within the collection, and to a lesser extent in the writer's mind, the more drops and plants you have, the easier it is to grow a new plant.

## How to Navigate
Here is the ideal navigation structure for a digital garden:
Links are powerful tools for connecting ideas. In a digital garden, knowledge isn't confined to a rigid tree-like structure of folders and sub-folders. Instead, it flourishes as an interconnected graph.
This structure reflects the cross-cutting nature of ideas, where a single concept can relate to many others across various contexts and topics.
By following these links, readers can make serendipitous discoveries and uncover interdisciplinary connections.

Both easily accessible and more obscure information have their place in a digital garden:
- Less familiar or more complex information may be harder to find, but it offers greater information gain. This aligns with the concept of information entropy: the more surprising or unexpected the information, the higher its value.
- Familiar or closely related information is easier to discover, forming a dense "knowledge web" that reinforces existing concepts and provides context for new ideas.

This structure encourages exploration and growth, much like tending to a real garden, where new plants (ideas) can take root and flourish alongside established ones.

Encouraging myself and readers to explore the garden can also help mitigate recency bias, while many social media platforms use recommendation algorithms that enforce this bias.
This cognitive bias leads us to favor ideas, arguments, and viewpoints that we've been exposed to recently, regardless of their actual merit.
By presenting a diverse array of interconnected ideas, older, but still valuable ideas remain accessible and don't get buried under newer content. 

## Problem of Updating Posts
To avoid perfectionism, not every post is equally refined. I can implement custom components(TODO) to hide my rough drafts; if you want to read those parts, you can click a button to show them.

If I constantly update posts, some readers may see unfinished content early on. Later, when I update the post, old readers have no effective way to "diff" the updated content, forcing them to re-read the whole thing.
