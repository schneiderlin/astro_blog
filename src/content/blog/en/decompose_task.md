When faced with a task that you find yourself procrastinating on, breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts can be an effective strategy.
I use [Magic TODO](https://goblin.tools/) to help me decompose task, it use LLM to
generate sub-tasks.

My todo list is not meant to be a permanent fixture, but rather a dynamic tool for immediate action and progress. 
When an item lingers on the list for an extended period, it often indicates one of two issues: either the task hasn't been broken down sufficiently into actionable steps, or it may not be worth doing at all.
The goal is to create momentum and progress, not to accumulate a long list of unfinished tasks, which will make me more likely to procrastinate.
