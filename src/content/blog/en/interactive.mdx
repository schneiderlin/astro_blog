## interactive

let's see how interactive this website can be?

I write my blog using astro, as in [blog setup](/blog/zh/astro_blog). the content is written in md or mdx, and rendered by astro.
in mdx, I can write html, and use react component.

### html
for example, I can write some html
```html
<div>
    <h1>hello</h1>
    <h2>hello</h2>
    <h3>hello</h3>
</div>
```

<div>
    <h1>hello</h1>
    <h2>hello</h2>
    <a id="example_a"></a>
    <h3>hello</h3>
</div>

### react component
or I can use a react component
```tsx
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from '@components/ui/alert';

<Alert variant="warning">
    <AlertTitle>Alert</AlertTitle>
    <AlertDescription>
        Alert description
    </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

<Alert variant="warning">
    <AlertTitle>Alert</AlertTitle>
    <AlertDescription>
        Alert description
    </AlertDescription>
</Alert>

but these are just content, how about a counter in react?
```tsx
import Counter from "@/components/Counter"

<Counter client:visible />
```

<Counter client:visible />

I need to add `client:visible` to make this component interactive. because astro default to strip all javascript for performance reason.

### link
If I want to quote some pharagraph from my other post, or this post. 
I can write a anchor tag with some id in the target location. for example, I write an anchor in the `<h3>` element before.
```html
<a id="example_a"></a>
<h3>hello</h3>
```

now I can link to it.
```html
<a href="#example_a">example a</a>
```

<a href="#example_a">example a</a>

### backlink
this is not implemented yet, but I want to know what other pages link to this paragraph.
I am thinking of using some tool to read and parse all the markdown file, and output a index file.
then I can see all the links between pages.

haven't figured out how to user interaction would be like, maybe when the user highlight some text, then show a popup window with links to
this paragraph?

### clojure 
I want whatever in the clojure block be render.
these clojure code 

<Reagent>
    [:div "hello"]
</Reagent>
