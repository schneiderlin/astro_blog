I need someone to 
- provide constructive feedback
- expanding network
- motivation and accountability
- bring more exposure

1. comment on my blog posts
2. recommand interesting resources to me
3. tell your friends about it
4. provide writing prompts or topic ideas
5. introduce me to other writers
6. tell me about writing communities
7. backlink to my blog

someone can be AI, AI can provide feedback, recommand resources, and generate writing prompts.
```text
what is your feedback on this post?
no need to comment on the structure and wordings, focus on the main idea.
do you have any dissagreements?
```

randomly chat with AI can provide writing ideas.

## Things I like to write about
- LLM generate narrative, many branch, human pruning
- open source projects, tutorials or rationales
    - how logseq implement link
- my tech choices
- argue no intellectual type
- outline for all my tech skills, it is also checkpoints, useful for context switching
- reverse goal setting
