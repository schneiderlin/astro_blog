## about language learning in public

hello, My name is ZiHao, I am from China.
Im currently learning English and bahasa Indonesia.

today Im gonna start this new project, "language learning in public"

what does it mean to learn in public.
is that I would write down the learning process of each day in this blog.
how does that benefit other people?


it mainly benefit me, coz the raw content is not well organized.
I need to organize the content, and then post it online, the process is also learning activity.

how others can benefit from it.
the best way is to participate along.


please help me build in public
- change my blog to multi language version
- show target content to my target audience
    - the audience in tandem, they are interesting in learning a language

## why I learn bahasa Indonesia
1. 
because when I want to test out the diffrent language learning strategy and tatics. 
so I pick a language that I have no prious experience, and start learning from scratch.

2.
bahasa indonesia is easy to learn, grammar rule is simple
and also no need to learn characters, it use latin alphabet.

3. 
there are many indonesian user in tandem, many of them want to learn Chinese, so we can mutually help each other.


## the tools and materials
I use duolingo, it has many very good basic to intermedia level materials.
and together with tandem, tandem is a very good place to help you keep motivated.

krashens theory, motivation is key.

and I use supermemo, it is a space repetition tools, which is very good for learning any materials.
I make flash card in supermemo, using anki is maybe a more popular option.

maybe one day I will write a script to export contents in supermemo to anki, so more people can follow along.

## the topics
write any topic you want to discus in here.
- introduction, name, city, hobby, occupation
- daily news
- share recipe
