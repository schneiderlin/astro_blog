## About

### About me
Hello, my name is ZiHao, and I'm from China. I'm currently learning English and Bahasa Indonesia, 
while also helping my Indonesian friend learn Mandarin.

As a programmer, I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and language learning. 
My background in software development has given me a unique perspective on how we can leverage technology to enhance the language learning process. 
I'm particularly interested in creating tools and systems that can make language acquisition more efficient and engaging.

Beyond my professional interests, I'm passionate about fostering multicultural connections. 
In our increasingly globalized world, I believe that understanding and appreciating different cultures is more important than ever. 
Learning languages is not just about communication; it's about building bridges between cultures, fostering empathy, 
and gaining new perspectives on the world.

One of my primary goals in this language learning journey is to reduce bias and promote cultural understanding. 
By immersing myself in different languages and cultures, 
I aim to challenge my own preconceptions and broaden my worldview. 
I believe that language learning can be a powerful tool for combating stereotypes and prejudices, 
as it allows us to engage directly with people from different backgrounds and understand their experiences firsthand.

### About this project, and Learning in public
This project is dedicated to documenting my journey in language learning and teaching. 
I hope that my notes and experiences will be helpful to others on similar paths.

An integral part of this project is the concept of "learning in public." 
By sharing my language learning journey openly, I'm embracing a powerful approach that offers numerous benefits:
1. **Accountability**: Documenting my progress and sharing it with others creates a sense of responsibility. 
2. **Motivation**: As more people engage with my content and follow along, 
the support and encouragement from the community fuel my enthusiasm and drive to continue improving.
3. **Feedback and Collaboration**: Learning in public opens up opportunities for valuable feedback from others. 
Whether it's native speakers, fellow learners, or language experts, their insights can help refine my approach and correct misconceptions.
5. **Documenting Progress**: It allows me to reflect on how far I've come and identify areas for improvement.
6. **Helping Others**: My notes, insights, and even mistakes can be valuable resources for other language learners. 

I invite you to join me on this journey, share your own experiences, and let's learn together!

## Learning Tools and Techniques

### Shadowing
One of the key techniques I've been using is shadowing, which I've detailed in my [The Benefits and Challenges of Shadowing](/blog/en/how_to_do_shadowing) blog post. This method has been particularly effective in improving my pronunciation and fluency.

### Real-time Chatting with AI Characters
Another technique I've been exploring is real-time chatting with AI characters on [Character.ai](https://character.ai). 
This platform now supports voice chat, which adds an exciting dimension to language learning. 
Character.ai also offers a wide range of AI characters covering various topics and roles. 
This diversity allows you to practice language in different contexts, from casual conversations to specialized discussions.

Character.ai has limitations for non-English languages, particularly in voice chat functionality. 
The main issue is that the speech recognition model often struggles to accurately transcribe what non-native speakers say
(possibly due to my bad pronunciation). 
This results in incorrect transcripts being sent to the text model, leading to misunderstandings and less effective interactions.

### Grammarly
[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is a popular writing assistant tool that uses artificial intelligence to check for grammar, spelling, punctuation, 
and style issues in written text. 

While it's a powerful tool for polishing writing, I primarily use it only for very formal occasions, 
such as composing work-related emails.
When it comes to acquiring a new language, I believe that grammar is less important than other aspects of language learning. 
My approach focuses on immersion and exposure to correct language usage. 
With enough practice using authentic materials in the target language, I find that grammatical structures are naturally acquired over time. 


### Language Exchange with Real Humans
[Tandem](https://www.tandem.net/) is a language exchange app that connects language learners from around the world. 
It allows users to practice languages with native speakers through text, voice, and video chats.

I've been using Tandem to find language exchange partners, and it has been an incredible experience. 
Through the app, I've connected with several wonderful people who have become not just language partners, but friends. 
In fact, these friendships and the progress I've made through these exchanges are a big part of why I decided to start this project. 

I now have regular virtual meetings with my friends approximately 5 times per week. 
As our community grows, I envision creating a network where learners and native speakers can connect more broadly, 
In the future, we could organize group video calls for multiple learners to practice together, 
supervised by native speakers, or even host skill-sharing workshops in various languages to combine language learning with other interests. 
Additionally, we can pre-propose some topics for discussion or play group games.

## Notes
Here are some key notes from my language exchange sessions with my friends.

## TODO
### Word Network
I'm exploring an innovative approach to language learning by creating a comprehensive word network. The idea is to:

1. Record and transcribe conversations
2. Index each word used
3. Create a system where clicking on a word retrieves all previous conversations containing that word

This approach would gradually evolve into a vast network of words and conversations. The visualization might look something like this:
<Image src={network} alt="Word network visualization" width="1200" height="1200" />
In this network, the words with the most connections represent the most frequently used words, providing valuable insights into language usage patterns.
This concept combines elements of contextual learning, frequency analysis, and interactive exploration, potentially offering a powerful tool for language learners at all levels.
