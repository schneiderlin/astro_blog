## About

### About me
Hello, my name is ZiHao, and I'm from China. I'm currently learning English and Bahasa Indonesia, 
while also helping my Indonesian friend learn Mandarin.

As a programmer, I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and language learning. 
My background in software development has given me a unique perspective on how we can leverage technology to enhance the language learning process. 
I'm particularly interested in creating tools and systems that can make language acquisition more efficient and engaging.

Beyond my professional interests, I'm passionate about fostering multicultural connections. 
In our increasingly globalized world, I believe that understanding and appreciating different cultures is more important than ever. 
Learning languages is not just about communication; it's about building bridges between cultures, fostering empathy, 
and gaining new perspectives on the world.

One of my primary goals in this language learning journey is to reduce bias and promote cultural understanding. 
By immersing myself in different languages and cultures, 
I aim to challenge my own preconceptions and broaden my worldview. 
I believe that language learning can be a powerful tool for combating stereotypes and prejudices, 
as it allows us to engage directly with people from different backgrounds and understand their experiences firsthand.

### About this project, and Learning in public
This project is dedicated to documenting my journey in language learning and teaching. 
I hope that my notes and experiences will be helpful to others on similar paths.

An integral part of this project is the concept of "learning in public." 
By sharing my language learning journey openly, I'm embracing a powerful approach that offers numerous benefits:
1. **Accountability**: Documenting my progress and sharing it with others creates a sense of responsibility. 
2. **Motivation**: As more people engage with my content and follow along, 
the support and encouragement from the community fuel my enthusiasm and drive to continue improving.
3. **Feedback and Collaboration**: Learning in public opens up opportunities for valuable feedback from others. 
Whether it's native speakers, fellow learners, or language experts, their insights can help refine my approach and correct misconceptions.
5. **Documenting Progress**: It allows me to reflect on how far I've come and identify areas for improvement.
6. **Helping Others**: My notes, insights, and even mistakes can be valuable resources for other language learners. 

I invite you to join me on this journey, share your own experiences, and let's learn together!

## Learning Techniques
One of the key techniques I've been using is shadowing, which I've detailed in my [The Benefits and Challenges of Shadowing](/blog/how_to_do_shadowing) blog post. This method has been particularly effective in improving my pronunciation and fluency.

## Word Network Concept
I'm exploring an innovative approach to language learning by creating a comprehensive word network. The idea is to:

1. Record and transcribe conversations
2. Index each word used
3. Create a system where clicking on a word retrieves all previous conversations containing that word

This approach would gradually evolve into a vast network of words and conversations. The visualization might look something like this:

<Image src={network} alt="Word network visualization" width="1200" height="1200" />

In this network, the words with the most connections represent the most frequently used words, providing valuable insights into language usage patterns.

This concept combines elements of contextual learning, frequency analysis, and interactive exploration, potentially offering a powerful tool for language learners at all levels.
