## about
hello, My name is ZiHao, I am from China.
I'm currently learning English and bahasa Indonesia, and helping my friend from Indonesia to learn Mandarin.

what I will do here is write down my notes during language learning, and teaching.
hope it will help other people too.

## notes

## word network
I would try to create as many links as possible. I have an idea, that each conversation's transcript, recorded and indexed, 
so whenever click on a word, all the previous conversations contain that word can be retrieved.

and it would gradually become a giant words and conversations network, It can then be visualize, maybe look like this
<Image src={network} alt="network" width="1200" height="1200" />
the words that has the most connection are the most frequently used word.
