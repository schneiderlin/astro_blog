## About
Hello, my name is ZiHao, and I'm from China. I'm currently learning English and Bahasa Indonesia, while also helping my Indonesian friend learn Mandarin.

This project is dedicated to documenting my journey in language learning and teaching. I hope that my notes and experiences will be helpful to others on similar paths.

## Learning Techniques
One of the key techniques I've been using is shadowing, which I've detailed in my [The Benefits and Challenges of Shadowing](/blog/how_to_do_shadowing) blog post. This method has been particularly effective in improving my pronunciation and fluency.

## Word Network Concept
I'm exploring an innovative approach to language learning by creating a comprehensive word network. The idea is to:

1. Record and transcribe conversations
2. Index each word used
3. Create a system where clicking on a word retrieves all previous conversations containing that word

This approach would gradually evolve into a vast network of words and conversations. The visualization might look something like this:

<Image src={network} alt="Word network visualization" width="1200" height="1200" />

In this network, the words with the most connections represent the most frequently used words, providing valuable insights into language usage patterns.

This concept combines elements of contextual learning, frequency analysis, and interactive exploration, potentially offering a powerful tool for language learners at all levels.
