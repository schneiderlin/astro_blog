title: AI overview
---

this is the overview page, AI can do a lot of stuff, and required a lot of knowledge.

don't hold AI at hand and looking for problems to solve, instead find problem first and try to solve it using AI.

## model I am using
using llama3 in ollama, run on local 4090. 
claude 3.5 sonnet using cursor.

## tools and libraries
[Oobabooga's Web UI](/ai/oobabooga) for text generation. \
[Bosquet](/ai/bosquet) for local LLM interaction. \
[Cursor](/ai/cursor) for codebase understanding.

## LLM 
all LLM can do is just continue writing at the end of sentence. it is important to know how to prompt are structured, 
how LLM fetch context from the outside world. there are many SaaS for doing RAG, or agent, or tool calling. these thing are not very technical advance,
just cleaver, so once find reference, it is easy to build a copy, at least for personal use.
by knowing the prompt, I can further customize.

being able to see the raw request send to LLM is crucial, some library hide the construction process.
using clojure, there is no need for framework like langchain, to gue many diffrent aspect of LLM together, clojure language itself is the best gue.

a good prompt template should be easy to mix code and data, and can also easily manipulate using code like hiccup.
