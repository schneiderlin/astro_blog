I want to write about how to increase my reach.
what is reach?

why increase reach?
- more feedback
- create momentum, shape the idea version of myself
- extend impact, can do more things
- more opportunities

if I have a broad audience, I can get more feedback.
the public image is usually more idealized, and I can shape it into what I want, audience can keep me accountable.
more reach also lead to more opportunities, people will start to routing interesting things to me. 
also I can extend my impact, do more things, with the help of other people, I can do more things.

what I have done
- blog
- X
- bilibili
- opensource work
- 1 on 1

the blog you are reading is also a attempt to increase reach. [A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox](). 
what a good blog should be, beside the visual appeal and technical stuff like loading speed and responsiveness and mobile friendly design.
It should arrange content in a way that is cognitively efficient for human. also entice the reader to continue reading, like writing a marketing campaign document.
also I want to include everything I have learned, and make it searchable.
I like the idea of digital gardening very much, so I will make the more polished blog post more likely to be seen, and hide the entry of more rough draft. 

what is digital garden.
I like the analogy in [How I built myself a Digital Garden](https://timrodenbroeker.de/digital-garden/). it contains 3 part clouds, drops, and plants.
cloud is excerpts of the raw material I consume.
drops are notes I make using my own words, each drop is a self-contained, minimal idea, with some links to other drops or cloud, I also keep a zettelkasten system for all my drops.
plants are the final text product, it can be a blog post, a video script, a design document, etc.

I gonna write some instruction of how to better navigate through this blog.

to avoid perfectionism, not every post is equally refined,
I can implement some custom component, to hide my rough draft, if you want to read that part, you can click a button to show it.

there is a problem is blogging, if I constantly update the post. some reader come in early and see some unfinished stuff, later I update the post, and the old reader
has no effective way to `diff` the updated content, they need to re-read the whole thing.


I started writing blog since 2018, many content is niche,
